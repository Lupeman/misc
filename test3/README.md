# Activity three.

## Brief
Choose your preferred JS framework and create an app which allows users to search and playing YouTube videos via the YouTube API. Anything goes here, so feel free to code as little/as much as you want in whatever JS based technology you're comfortable with.
We'll be looking specifically at your approach to a full project in JS that makes use of a Restful API. We're likely to be more interested in the tools you choose and and how well you use them over the beauty of the finished product (though a slick interface won't be overlooked).

This application was developed on OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6.

## Technologies used:

* HTML, CSS, JS, Handlebars, Underscore.js, jQuery, Gulp.

# Thoughts

* I originally thought about using React with Node.js or Backbone but decided not to overcomplicate things. I just needed a simple update to the view upon the user searching for videos and figured handlebars would be adequate for the app.

## Possible Improvements

* Could list out results as links to appropriate videos.
* Work on page responsiveness.
