# Activity two.

## Brief
Implement a banner carousel for a web page. This is a commonly used piece of functionality and we are keen to see how you would approach it. We don't expect you to write an entire plugin from scratch, but we'd like to see how you approach putting something together that addresses the following key areas:
 * Animated slide transitions.
 * Responsive layouts.
 * User interaction/controls.
 * Consideration of accessibility.
We'll be looking at a combination of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you use. Feel free to use placeholder images for the banners, alternatively we'd love you to show us how we could have implemented some of our own banner designs better.

This application was developed on OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6.

## Technologies used:

  * HTML, CSS, JS

# Thoughts

  * I enjoy experimenting with css animations and thought it would be interesting to give the slide some perspective. 

## Possible Improvements

  * Images are slightly different heights.
  * Image bottom cut off on resize.
  * Accessibility could be improved. At the moment users are able to:
      * Pause slide movement.
      * Play through slides.
      * Move forward or backwards through slides with arrows.
      * Color contrast ratio 9.79:1.

  * Given more time I would implement the slide nav dots. At the moment they are purely cosmetic.
